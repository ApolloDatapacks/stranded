**Stranded** is a mod that adds a world type with a single island at spawn with the rest of the world being ocean!

## Description

This mod adds a new world type which lets you create a circular-ish island surrounded by an infinite ocean. This world type has customization options for the radius of the island and whether or not the mod is in "compatible mode" (made for using the mod with Terralith, Tectonic, William Wyther's Overhauled Overworld).

### Known Issues

- A stranded config file will be generated for any world, regardless of whether or not it uses the Stranded world type.
- The Continents mod will never work with Stranded, even if the Stranded world type is not selected.

### Credits

This mod includes code from [Maze World](https://modrinth.com/mod/mazeworld) (for handling the custom customizable world type), which is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/replaceitem/mazeworld/blob/master/LICENSE).
